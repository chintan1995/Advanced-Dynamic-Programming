Nqueen Solution
----------------
Nqueen is a problem where you need to place N queens on the chess board of size NxN such that no two queens can attack each other. 
Meaning all queens must be safe at where they are placed. 
The problem has been approached by using dynamic backtracking technique (recursion).

For input, you need to enter N, which is the board size of NxN when the program is executed.


Sudoku Solver
--------------
Sudoku is a game, where there is a board of size 9x9, and there are 9 sub-blocks each of size 3x3. 
You need to fill the board with numbers from 1 to 9 where the number should not get repeated in the same row, same column, or the same sub-block it is placed in.
The problem has been approached by using dynamic backtracking technique.

For inputing the raw (initial) sudoku board you need to enter the initial numbers in a file called "sudoku.txt" (already given in repo), in a 9x9 matrix format.
